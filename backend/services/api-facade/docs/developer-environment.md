## Development Environment

It's possible to set up a short lived development environment for this service using [SST's](https://docs.sst.dev/live-lambda-development) local development capabilities.

See the [guide here](https://github.com/Shieldpay/optimus/blob/master/scripts/sst/README.md) for instructions on how to set this up.
